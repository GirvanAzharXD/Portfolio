# Portfolio Website - Copilot Instructions

This is a modern portfolio website built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

## Project Structure
- **React 18** with functional components and hooks
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with custom animations
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations and transitions
- **Lucide React** for icons

## Coding Standards
- Use functional components with React Hooks
- Follow modern ES6+ JavaScript syntax
- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- Implement responsive design (mobile-first approach)
- Use Framer Motion for animations and transitions
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add proper error handling where needed

## Design Principles
- Dark theme with gradient accents (blue, purple, cyan)
- Modern, clean, and minimalist design
- Smooth animations and micro-interactions
- Responsive layout for all screen sizes
- Accessible color contrasts and navigation
- Professional typography (Inter font family)

## Animation Guidelines
- Use Framer Motion for page transitions and scroll animations
- Implement stagger animations for lists and grids
- Add hover effects for interactive elements
- Use `whileInView` for scroll-triggered animations
- Keep animations smooth and not overwhelming

## Component Guidelines
- Each section should be a separate component
- Use motion components from Framer Motion
- Implement proper TypeScript types if converting to TS
- Add loading states for form submissions
- Handle responsive behavior within components

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize images and use appropriate formats
- Lazy load components and images when possible
- Minimize bundle size
- Use proper React optimization techniques
- Implement efficient scroll listeners
